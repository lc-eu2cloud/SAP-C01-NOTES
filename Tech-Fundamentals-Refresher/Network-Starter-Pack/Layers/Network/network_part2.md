#### IP Addressing(v4) - IPv4
**Parts of an IP address (Network & Host)**
* network: IP network an IP address belongs to (ie 133.33)
* host: represents hosts/devices on an IP network (ie 3.7, one device, a laptop)

**Differentiating between IP networks**
* two different IP addresses with same network part are on the same IP network (if not, they're on different IP networks)
* Example: 133.33.3.7 <- /16 prefix (first 16 bits represent network part, remaining 16 bits represent host part) 
* an IP address's (133.33.33.37) network part matches network part of 1st IP address (133.33) -> on same IP network
