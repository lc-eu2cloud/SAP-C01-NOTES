## Network Starter Pack - 1 - Physical ##

#### Layer 1 - Physical ####
Scenario
* 2 laptops on your local network & want to play a local area network (LAN) game between the 2 laptops
* you need to either connect both laptops to the same wifi network or use a physical network cable (in this scenario: using a physical connection between the 2 laptops)
  * both laptops have network interface card & connected using a network cable
  * in this scenario, you're assuming the network cable used is a copper network cable 
    * a point to point electrical shared medium between the two devices
    * a piece of cable which can be used to transmit electrical signals between the two network interface cards
* a physical medium can be copper (uses electrical signals), fibre (uses light), or wifi (uses radio frequency or RF)

* no matter what the type of physical medium used, it needs a way to be able to carry unstructured (raw) information
* what solves that? Layer 1 or physical layer standards known as specifications:
  * which define how to transmit & receive raw bit streams (1s & 0s) between a device & shared physical medium (in this scenario: a piece of copper network cable between 2 laptops)
  * define things like voltage levels, timings, data rates, usable distances, modulation method, & connector type on each end of the physical cable
  * in this scenario, mean both laptops have a shared understanding of the physical medium (cable)
