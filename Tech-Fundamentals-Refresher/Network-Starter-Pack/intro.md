## Network Starter Pack - 0 - Intro ##

#### Networking Reference Points ####
* Local Networking - how data moves between devices on your local network (foundational to understanding how data moves across the internet from starting to ending point)
* Routing - how data moves across the internet from your network to somewhere else (AWS or Netflix) via many interconnected networks
* Segmenting, Ports & Sessions - components which ensure reliable data transfer used by your **applications**
* OSI 7-Layer Model - breaking up networking components into 7 layers (distinct components), starting at bottom with physical networking & ending at the top with application networking
#### OSI 7-Layer Model ####
* since OSI model conceptual (7 layers stacked on top of each other), not always how networking software is implemented
* start with physical -> data link -> network -> transport -> session -> presentation -> application (aka networking stack or software that does each of these functions)
